                    b How Does Your Audience See Your Brand?
                  p As you might expect, the language you use on your site turns some people into fans and leaves others indifferent because they simply value different things. By being aware of these connections you can evaluate your content in terms of the values it embodies, and make modifications to your communication strategy if necessary.
                  p Some famous marketing campaigns have focused on specific core values to create powerful emotions in the hearts of their audience.

                    b Brand Character: "The Pentagon"
                  p Your brand character pentagon represents either a concentrated, balanced, or diversified brand depending on how many of the five dimensions you engage in. Concentrated if you clearly only prioritize one dimension, balanced in the case of two dimensions, or diversified for three dimensions. Each dimension stands for a broad orientation of the brand. The five dimensions are:
                  ul(style="margin-left: 20px;")
                    li Sincere, "We care about people."
                    li Excitement, "Let’s have some fun!"
                    li Competence, "Trust us, we are the experts."
                    li Sophisticated, "Looks and Status are ours."
                    li Ruggedness, "We’re tough, period." (also includes outdoorsy brands)
                  p As a rule of thumb, early stage brands should strive to adopt a concentrated or balanced brand character approach in order to send a very clear message to their audience. Later on, brands often tend to diversify to appeal to a broader audience. They become more mainstream.

                  h3 Brand Values: Primary Core Values

                  h3 Core Values Analysis
                  p Based on your core values, is your brand adopting a concentrated, balanced, or diversified communication strategy?  Here is how to find out:
   
                  ul(style="margin-left: 20px;")
                    li Concentrated: 1 or 2 dominant values belonging to the same orientation.
                    li Balanced: 2 to 4 dominant values belonging to no more than 2 orientations.
                    li Diversified: 5 equally distributed dominant core values belonging to two or more orientations.
